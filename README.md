## Introduction

## Readability

### Typos should be corrected

### Variable and function names should be clear

### Functions should be short

### Files should be short

### Exported functions should be documented

### Complex code should be commented

## Handling Side Effects

### Functions should be as pure as possible (without side effects)

### I/O functions should have failure cases handled

### Null cases should be handled

### Singular or Plural cases should be handled

### Functions should handle unexpected user input

## Maintainability

### Functions should use efficient algorithms and data structures

### Important actions should be logged

### New code should be tested

### Commit messages should be clear and accurately describe new code
